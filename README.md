# LAPACK interfaces

Interfaces to basic linear algebra subprograms.


## Building from source

To build this project from the source code in this repository you need to have

- a Fortran compiler supporting Fortran 2008

  - GFortran 8 or newer
  - Intel Fortran 18 or newer

- One of the supported build systems

  - [meson](https://mesonbuild.com) version 0.55 or newer
  - [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.9 or newer
  - [Fortran package manager (fpm)](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) version 0.2.0 or newer

Get the source by cloning the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/grimme-lab/lapack-interface
cd lapack-interface
```

### Building with meson

To build this project with meson a build-system backend is required, *i.e.* [ninja](https://ninja-build.org) version 1.7 or newer.
Setup a build with

```
meson setup _build --prefix=/path/to/install
```

You can select the Fortran compiler by the `FC` environment variable.
To compile the project run

```
meson compile -C _build
```

Finally, you can install TOML Fortran using

```
meson install -C _build
```



### Building with CMake

While meson is the preferred way to build this project it also offers CMake support.
Configure the CMake build with

```
cmake -B _build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install
```

Similar to meson the compiler can be selected with the `FC` environment variable.
You can build the project using

```
cmake --build _build
```

Finally, you can install TOML Fortran using

```
cmake --install _build
```


### Building with fpm

The Fortran package manager ([fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm)) supports the addition of this interface library as a dependency.
In the package manifest, `fpm.toml`, you can add this project dependency via:

```toml
[dependencies]
lapack-interface.git = "https://github.com/grimme-lab/lapack-interface"
```

Then build and test normally.

```
fpm build
fpm test
```
